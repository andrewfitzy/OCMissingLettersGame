#Only Connect Letters Game
The BBC program, Only Connect, has a letters game in the last round where words are presented with the vowels removed; each word relates to one of 5 or 6 categories for that round, each category having 3 or 4 questions.

For instance, if the category were car makers clues may be presented as follows:
VXHLL
Answer: Vauxhall

FRD
Answer: Ford

LPHRM
Answer: Alpha Romeo

Then the next category might be TV shows:
STNDRS
Answer: EastEnders

And so on.
