#Only Connect Letters Game
The BBC program, Only Connect, has a letters game in the last round where words are presented with the vowels removed; each word relates to one of 5 or 6 categories for that round, each category having 3 or 4 questions.

For instance, if the category were car makers clues may be presented as follows:
VXHLL
Answer: Vauxhall

FRD
Answer: Ford

LP HRM
Answer: Alpha Romeo

Then the next category might be TV shows:
STNDRS
Answer: EastEnders

And so on. You'll notice that the third car, Alpha Romeo, hsa a space in the name, the number of spaces in the answer are preserved however they do not appear in the same position as you would expect to find them in the full name.
